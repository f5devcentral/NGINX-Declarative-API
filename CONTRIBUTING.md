## Code Guidelines

### Git Guidelines

- Keep a clean, concise and meaningful git commit history on your branch (within reason), rebasing locally and squashing before submitting a PR.
- If possible and/or relevant, use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format when writing a commit message, so that changelogs can be automatically generated
- Follow the guidelines of writing a good commit message as described here <https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/> and summarised in the next few points:
  - In the subject line, use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
  - In the subject line, use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
  - Limit the subject line to 72 characters or less.
  - Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the subject line.
  - Add more detailed description in the body of the git message (`git commit -a` to give you more space and time in your text editor to write a good message instead of `git commit -am`).
