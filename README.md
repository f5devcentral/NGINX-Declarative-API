# NGINX-Declarative-API

[![Project Status: Active â€“ The project has reached a stable, usable state and is being actively developed.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/active.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#active)

This project provides a set of declarative REST API for [NGINX Instance Manager](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-management-suite/nim/) and [NGINX One Console](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-one/)

It can be used to manage NGINX Plus configuration lifecycle and to create NGINX Plus configurations using JSON service definitions.

GitOps integration is supported: source of truth is checked for updates (NGINX App Protect policies, TLS certificates, keys and chains/bundles, Swagger/OpenAPI definitions, snippets) and NGINX configurations are automatically kept in sync.

Use cases include:

- Integration with NGINX Instance Manager (instance group) and NGINX One Console (config sync group)
- NGINX App Protect DevSecOps integration (NGINX Instance Manager only)
- API Gateway deployments with automated Swagger / OpenAPI schema import
- API Developer portals zero-touch deployment (redocly and backstage supported)
- API Visibility (moesif supported)
- GitOps integration with source of truth support for
  - NGINX App Protect WAF policies
  - TLS certificates, keys and chains/bundles
  - mTLS certificates
  - `http` snippets, upstreams, servers, locations
  - `stream` snippets, upstreams, servers
  - Swagger / OpenAPI schemas
  - NGINX Javascript

A **blog article** to automate NGINX API Gateway management from OpenAPI schemas is available [here](https://www.f5.com/company/blog/nginx/from-openapi-to-nginx-as-an-api-gateway-using-a-declarative-api)

## Supported releases

- [NGINX Instance Manager 2.14+](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-management-suite/nim/)
- [NGINX One Console](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-one/)
- [NGINX Plus R33+](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx/)
- NGINX App Protect WAF [4](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-app-protect-waf/v4/) and [5](https://docs.nginx.com/nginx-app-protect-waf/v5/)

**Note**: NGINX Plus R33 and above [require a valid license](https://docs.nginx.com/solutions/about-subscription-licenses/) and the `.output.license` section in the declarative JSON is required. See the [usage notes](/USAGE-v5.3.md) for further details. [Postman collection](/contrib/postman) examples are provided for R33.
